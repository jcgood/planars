# Next session

Standing prompt for resuming work in a fresh Claude session. Open a new session
and say: **"Read NextPrompt.md and carry on."**

**This file holds no state.** What is done, what is next, and why lives in
`docs/data-layer-progress.md` and the issue tracker, which own those facts. The
one thing here that needs editing between sessions is the *Now* line below.
Everything else is standing instruction and should change rarely. If you find
yourself copying a paragraph of status into this file, it belongs in the
progress doc instead — a second description of the same fact is the exact defect
this project is trying to remove.

## Now

**Data layer migration (#271), Phase 0b/1 is complete** (finished 2026-08-04,
`restructure_sheets.py` — file 18 of 18 — was last). Every command in
`coding/` that reaches Google now goes through the doorway;
`tests/test_doorway_coverage.py` confirms this with an empty `_REMAINING`.
There is no next file to migrate.

**Next up is Phase 3 of `docs/data-layer-implementation-plan.md`** ("Schema
reorganization"), which the plan itself marks **"(coordinator decides)"** —
it is the highest-value and highest-risk phase, and starting it requires a
decision from Jeff first, not an agent's guess at what the split should look
like. Read `docs/data-layer-progress.md` § "Next action" for the current
state of that gate before doing anything else on this effort. Two small,
non-blocking findings from the last migration (Findings 16 and 17, both
mechanical, neither needing Jeff's judgment) are recorded in that file's
Findings section for whoever next touches `restructure_sheets.py`.

## Read first, in this order

1. `docs/data-layer-progress.md` — the authoritative state: what is done, what
   is next, the migration order, the findings log, the decisions log, and the
   per-file procedure as actually executed. **Start here.**
2. `docs/data-layer-design.md` — the diagnosis and constraints. Read before any
   design call.
3. `coding/drive_doorway.py` — the module docstring explains the doorway and
   the choices behind it.

`docs/data-layer-implementation-plan.md` is the phase spec; consult it when the
progress doc points you there.

## Constraints that matter most

- **No live Drive writes.** `capture-drive-state` (read-only) is the only
  permitted live call before Phase 9.
- **Adam is annotating.** His data must not change. `coded_data/` must be clean
  before you start and clean when you stop.
- **In the throwaway harness, make every unshimmed route to Google raise.**
  Patching `coding.drive._get_clients` is not enough for a command that did
  `from .drive import _get_clients` — that binding lives in the command's own
  module. The harness reached live Drive once for exactly this reason; see the
  2026-08-02 decisions-log entry.
- **Never normalise or hand-edit anything under `tests/fixtures/drive_state/`.**
  Those are recorded responses and their exact shape is load-bearing. Re-run
  the capture instead.
- **Watch for `_save_drive_config` in the file you are migrating.** It must be
  patched in tests — the real `drive_config.json` holds live IDs, and a test
  that clobbers it breaks access to the coordinator's own Drive.

## How to work

*(This section documents the per-file method Phase 0b/1 used, now finished.
Kept as reference — the reasoning about evidence order and where bugs hide
outlives that one phase — not as a live instruction with a next file to
apply it to.)*

- Use the per-file method written up in the progress doc: drive the unmigrated
  code from a stand-in Drive through shims, capture its output and its Drive
  changes, migrate, run the same thing again, and diff. Only then capture
  snapshots. The shims are per-file throwaways and stay in the scratchpad.
- Evidence order: mechanical pre/post diff first, property assertions second,
  human review last and only on a rendered digest
  (`tests/render_mutations.py`). A pre/post diff cannot catch a fake that is
  wrong the same way on both sides — assertions that state the command's
  *promise* are what catch that class.
- Commit at every file boundary, updating `docs/data-layer-progress.md` in the
  same commit. Push after every commit.
- `tests/test_doorway_coverage.py` derives which files are left and checks the
  counts stated in the progress doc. Update its `_REMAINING` list and
  `coding/CLAUDE.md` in the same commit as the migration.
- Run `pytest` with `run_in_background`.
- When a snapshot reveals odd behaviour, record it in the progress doc's
  Findings rather than fixing it in the same change — but **the deferral
  expires when that file's migration is committed**, not when the migration
  ends. Fix it then, as its own commit, with the snapshot diff as the evidence.
  Small fixes otherwise happen on sight.
- Read the language rule in `CLAUDE.md` before writing anything a person will
  read. Plain words; a new term only when the project has no word for the
  concept.

## Scale, so the count does not mislead (Phase 0b/1 reference — now finished at 18 of 18)

The order was smallest-and-safest first, so "N of 18" flattered the progress
for most of the effort. Recompute rather than trusting any written number if
this is ever relevant again: the command is in `tests/test_doorway_coverage.py`
(`_DIRECT_ACCESS` over `coding/*.py`, minus `_EXEMPT`) — it should now report
zero remaining. The largest three files were deliberately last.
